# Fantasy-API
Thank you for using my fantasy app :)

You will need mongo db installed

Windows 64bit 
https://studio3t.com/download-thank-you/?OS=win64

To use:

1. Open the project and type npm install 
2. In the terminal type node updatePlayers
    2a. If you get rate limited, go to the last instance in your mongodb (I reccomend mongo compass) and comment out what is already loaded, launch updatePlayers again
3. Once your DB is full type node app and your backend is now running.
